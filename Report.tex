\title{CSCE 465 Cryptography in Action Progress Report}

\begin{abstract}
    Since as early as the ancient Roman days, secret messages have been sent from a command post to the front during wartime. With the constant risk of messengers being captured and their messages intercepted, a method of ensuring that only the authorized parties were able to read messages was necessary. Such is the beginning of cryptography and the battle to devise new ways to break cryptographic systems. This project seeks to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses in current popular cryptographic systems such as RSA, El Gamal, DES, Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, and more. To do this, a client and a server are connected over the TCP/IP stack and exchange information about keys and the encryption algorithm to be used. Then, the client will send an encrypted message to the server, and the server will decrypt this and respond back with its own encrypted message. The client will then be able to decrypt and read this reply. Meanwhile, a malicious user will capture the encrypted communications en route and attempt to break the cryptographic system. To do this, a brute force and a more intelligent method will be used to recover the plaintext from the ciphertext. In this report, we analyze and discuss the performance of each of these attack vectors.

\section{Introduction}
This project contains several classes and Python code files which serve to make a generic client and server object to send encrypted messages using the TCP/IP stack. By default, the client and the server will use RSA encryption, but El Gamal, DES, or a One-Time-Pad can be used as well.
